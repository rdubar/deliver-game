# Deliverance: The Delivery Game
### *or Every Van For Themselves...*
Experience all the thrills of being a delivery driver, battling with traffic, customers, huge corporations and faceless AI systems, all from the comfort of your own home! 
## Rules of the Game
* Download and print the gameboard. Choose an item to represent each player
* Use a size sided dice, or use the webapp to choose a random number from 1-6 for you.
* Either choose items to respresent Stars and "Luck Break" tokens, or keep a written note.
* Each player starts at the Depot on the game board.
* Each player throws one six sided dice, the highest throw goes first.
* Each player throws the dice, and moves forward that number of spaces, then takes a card.
* Card bonuses or penalties are applied: move forward of backward as directed.
* If the player has gone forward round the board and reached the Depot, they collect another star!
* If you are unlucky, you may lose a star, or have to go back to the Depot without collecting a star.
* Players may gain “Lucky Break” tokens, which can be used once each at any time to avoid any one penalty. Use them wisely!
* If you land on a "Lucky Break" space, take a Lucky break token. 
* If a card says you lose a "Lucky Break" or stars but have none left to lose, miss a turn instead. 
* If there are no other players to take a star or "Lucky Break" from, you can take one from the bank instead.
* The winner is the first player to collect five stars.
