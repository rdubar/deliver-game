# Deliverance: The Delivery Game
### *or Every Van For Themselves...*
Experience all the thrills of being a delivery driver, battling with traffic, customers, huge corporations and faceless AI systems, all from the comfort of your own home! 
## Rules of the Game
* Download and print the gameboard and (optionally) the game tolens.
* Shuffle the game cards if you have them, or use the app to randomly draw cards for you.
* Use a six sided dice, or use the app to choose a random number from 1-6 for you.
* If you don't have the game tokens and game cards, choose items to respresent players, Stars and "Luck Break" tokens, or keep written notes.
* Each player starts at the Depot on the game board.
* Each player throws one six sided dice, the highest throw goes first.
* On their turn, each player throws the dice, and moves forward that number of spaces.
* The player then takes a card, any penalty or bous is applied.
* If players are told to go back or forward a number of spaces, any further penalty or bonus is also applied.
* If a player is told to take another turn, they do so before anyone else plays. 
* If the player has gone forward round the board and reached the Depot, they collect another star!
* If you are unlucky, you may lose a star, or have to go back to the Depot without collecting a star.
* Players may gain “Lucky Break” tokens, which can be used once each at any time to avoid any one penalty, or to re-roll the dice if you get a result you do not want. 
* Hand your "Lucky Break" tokens back to the bank once they have been played. Use them wisely!
* If a card says you lose a "Lucky Break" or a Star but have none left to lose, they miss a turn instead. 
* If there are no other players to take a star or "Lucky Break" from, you can take one from the bank instead.
* The winner is the first player to collect five stars.
* For added excitement, see the optional "Special Delivery" rules!
